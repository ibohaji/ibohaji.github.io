  <h1 class="magazine-title">The pursuit of happiness</h1>

  <p class="magazine-intro-text">The question of happiness has never more relevant than in the past couple of years. From the covid-19 pandemic and the accompanying lockdown restrictions on our lives and the loss of jobs, to the war in Ukraine, our subjective happiness have been questionable. Additionaly the increasing fuel prices and its domino effect on the prices of basic goods and necessity have further impacted our well-bieng.</p> 
  
  <p> Therefore, we decided to delve deeper into the single elements that makes us “happy”, according to the <a href = "worldhappiness.report"> World Happiness Report </a> these five elements can be categorized as: healthy life expectancy, freedom to take life decisions, GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, perception of corruption and social support.</p>

  <p>And while these metric might help in explaining the happiness and well-being of a population, it’s also worthwhile to note that happiness is subjective and the ingredients for one nation’s well-being might not necessarily be the same for another nation as they differ in terms of culture and other socio-economic factors.</p>

At first glance nothing seems out of the ordinary, and as we might have suspected or expected, the nordic countries are leading the way in terms of happiness score and rank, followed by north america and western europe.
However what is exactly causing this pronounced contrast between the happiness scores of Africa, Southern Asia and the Nordic countries. What are the main factors for this contrast? Can we objectively define what contributes to happiness from subjectively derived data ?

  <p class="magazine-section-text">The average life expectancy between among the regions seems to almost follow the same trend for the happiness scores presented previously, as we’ve expected previously and will explore more in depth in the next figure to see if we can find a correlation between the healthy life expectancy and the happiness score.  </p>

  <p class="magazine-section-text">Examining the significance of social connections and support networks, we investigate how strong social ties contribute to happiness and well-being, focusing on diverse communities globally. Similar to Life expectancy, Happiness is more highly correlated with Social support for countries outside of Africa than countries in Africa. </p>

  <h2 class="magazine-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="magazine-section-text">After observing the Happiness score over 5 elements for countries in and outside of Africa, there is a significant difference in what determines Happiness score for different parts of the world. Happiness is highly correlated with elements such as "Social Support", "Healthy life expectancy" and "GDP per capita" for countries outside of Africa. On the other hand, happiness for Countries in Africa are not highly correlated with most of these elements. The way one views Happiness is shaped by their cultural and social upbringing. Some other elements that we can explore to find out what determines happiness for countries in Africa are education and religion.
