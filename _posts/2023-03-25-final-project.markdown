  <h1 class="magazine-title">The pursuit of happiness</h1>

  <p class="magazine-intro-text">The question of happiness has never more relevant than in the past couple of years. From the covid-19 pandemic and the accompanying lockdown restrictions on our lives and the loss of jobs, to the war in Ukraine, our subjective happiness have been questionable. Additionaly the increasing fuel prices and its domino effect on the prices of basic goods and necessity have further impacted our well-bieng.</p> 
  
  <p> Therefore, we decided to delve deeper into the single elements that makes us “happy”, according to the <a href = "worldhappiness.report"> World Happiness Report </a> these five elements can be categorized as: healthy life expectancy, freedom to take life decisions, GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, perception of corruption and social support.</p>

  <p>And while these metric might help in explaining the happiness and well-being of a population, it’s also worthwhile to note that happiness is subjective and the ingredients for one nation’s well-being might not necessarily be the same for another nation as they differ in terms of culture and other socio-economic factors.</p>

At first glance nothing seems out of the ordinary, and as we might have suspected or expected, the nordic countries are leading the way in terms of happiness score and rank, followed by north america and western europe.
However what is exactly causing this pronounced contrast between the happiness scores of Africa, Southern Asia and the Nordic countries. What are the main factors for this contrast? Can we objectively define what contributes to happiness from subjectively derived data ?

  <p class="magazine-section-text">The average life expectancy among the regions seems to favour the countries that scored high on happiness over their less happy counterparts. A healthier and longer life means better access to health-care systems, affordability of medicine and disease prevention not to mention clean access to water and sanitation which are all part of the <a href = "https://sdgs.un.org/goals"> sustainable development goals.</a> 
  we will further more investigate the relationship between healthy life expectency and and the other variables, in the interactive graph below we can observe the linear relationship between the happiness and healthy life expectency, we can see a trend that the the least happy countries seem to have a lower expectancy.

     <div class="photo-caption">From 2015 to 2026, we can see a general trend that the higher the life expectancy, the higher the happiness score. This trend is unsurprising as one would expect one to be more happy with better health. We encourage you take a look at the data, select the countries your most curious about and investigate their relationship.

     <div class="photo-caption">When we narrow down to countries in Africa, it can be seen that the correlation between life expectancy and happiness is much lower. This correlation remains higher for countries outside of Africa. This could be a possible explanation that life expectancy is not as determining of a factor for Happiness Score for countries in Africa as compared to those outside of Africa.</div>

     <div class="photo-caption">Taking a look at how Freedom to make life decisions is correlated with Happiness Score, we can see that there is a significant difference between countries in and outside of Africa.

  <p class="magazine-section-text">The GDP as well is one of the highest indicator of a nations happiness and it's citezens well-bieng, while this statement might but 100% accurate in an ideal world with an equaly distributed GD but however, the GDP is not metric for it's citizens well-bieng as it does not account for how the GDP is distributed nor the inequality rate. </p>

     <div class="photo-caption">An interesting observation is that there is a downwards trend for happiness score over trust for countries in Africa. Could this be an indicator that countries in Africa do not value Trust (Government Corruption) as highly as countries outside of Africa as a determination for happiness?</div>

  <p class="magazine-section-text">Examining the significance of social connections and support networks, we investigate how strong social ties contribute to happiness and well-being, focusing on diverse communities globally. Similar to Life expectancy, Happiness is more highly correlated with Social support for countries outside of Africa than countries in Africa. </p>

<h2 class = "magazine-section_title"> Who are the top gainers in happiness ? </h2>
<p class = "magazine-section-text"> If we could leave the reader with one thing, it'll rather be this positive insight. As "Unhappy" the previous analysis have shown africa to be in all terms of all the 5 metrics used to describe happiness, supringsly enough all the top 5 gainers in happiness are African nations as displayed by the below plot.

As the leaders of the nations become more aware of the happiness report and embed them as a key indicator of societal progress and well-bieng, they can take informed initiative to further deploy policies and programs that contribute the overall happiness and wellbieng of it's citizens.</p>

<div class="magazine-section">
  <h2 class="magazine-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="magazine-section-text">After observing the Happiness score over 5 elements for countries in and outside of Africa, there is a significant difference in what determines Happiness score for different parts of the world. Happiness is highly correlated with elements such as "Social Support", "Healthy life expectancy" and "GDP per capita" for countries outside of Africa. On the other hand, happiness for Countries in Africa are not highly correlated with most of these elements. The way one views Happiness is shaped by their cultural and social upbringing. Some other elements that we can explore to find out what determines happiness for countries in Africa are education and religion.
